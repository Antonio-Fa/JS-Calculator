For the design of this calculator I used a grid of buttons inside a flex box to center. InnerHTML was used to write the button faces and were styled with CSS.

For the calculator functions, I decided to create a class and created functions within the class that can be accessed.

I handled inputs using innerHTML and an event listener. Each subset of buttons had theier own class which let me use a 'forEach' to gather inputs from all catergories without needing to write unquie lines of code for each individual button. (numbers, operators, equals, clear)
